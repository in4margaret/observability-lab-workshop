# Adding basic Observability ~~Infrastructure~~ Instrumentation

> Goal: Exploring different options to instrument standard applications with standard tooling and easily integrate them into Azure for data collection and observability.

In this section we are going to build the observability solution step by step by using automatic OpenTelemetry instrumentation.

1. OtelCollector and the alternatives 
2. Auto instrumentation of .Net application 
3. Auto instrumentation of Java application

> Note: Have a section (5. Advanced instrumentation) on manual tracing, etc
